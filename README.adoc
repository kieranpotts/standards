= Technical Standards

These technical standards are a set of general guidelines for software
development that I have curated to help me write high quality, high value
software products.

The scope of these technical standards is broad. At the highest levels they
cover principles of software design and architecture, and at lower levels they
cover coding conventions for a wide variety of computer languages.

== Requirements levels

Throughout the technical standards documents, the capitalized keywords
"REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"OPTIONAL", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119].

== Contributing

To make changes to a technical standard, or to create a new one, use the
normal pull request workflow via GitHub.
