= Technical Standards

These technical standards are a set of general guidelines for software development that I have curated over time to help me write high quality, high value software products.

The scope of these technical standards is broad. They cover all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from requirements specification and system design, via coding conventions and testing strategies, to deployment and monitoring. These standards apply to production systems, development tools, and operations infrastructure, but not to prototypes, proofs of concept, or other temporary artifacts.

In an enterprise context, the inclusion of a technology in a technical standard indicates that the technology is approved for use in development, testing, and operations. Organization-level technical standardization is important to contain technical sprawl, especially in large-scale distributed software systems.

The purpose of technical standards is to define what "good" looks like from a technical perspective. Technical standards are therefore owned by a project's technical stakeholders. Topics such as project management and product ownership are out of scope. Technical standards describe desirable end results, but not the process of reaching those results.

== Requirements levels

Throughout the technical standards documents, the capitalized keywords "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "OPTIONAL", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC2119].

== Style guide

=== Language

These technical standards are written in American English.

=== Conventions

URLs containing variables are written according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570[IETF RFC 6570: URI Template]. For example, a URL containing a variable called `account_id` would be shown as `api.example.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}`.

=== Terminology

// TODO

== Contributing

These technical standards are living documents. To make changes to a technical standard, or to create a new one, use the normal pull request workflow via GitHub.

Technical standards documents are written in the AsciiDoc format, as specified in the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoctor docs]. Long technical standards documents – with two or more sections – MUST include a table of contents, generated automatically by the AsciiDoc processor. Use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/toc/position/[TOC macro] to control the position of the TOC in each document, after the introductory text and before the first section.

```
= TS-1: Technical Standard #1
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

toc::[]

== Section 1

```

Any books, blogs, or other third-party media that influenced the content of a technical standard MUST be listed in a references section at the end of the document.
