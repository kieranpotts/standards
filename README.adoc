= Technical Standards

These technical standards are a set of general guidelines for software development that I have curated over time to support the creation of high-quality, high-value software products.

Technical standards define what "`good`" looks like from a technical perspective. The scope is broad, covering all aspects of the software development lifecycle: requirements specification, system design, coding conventions, testing strategies, deployment, and monitoring. But topics such as project management and product ownership are out of scope. Technical standards describe the desired end state, not the process for achieving it.

Technical standards are owned by a project's technical stakeholders. In an enterprise context, including a technology in a technical standard signifies that it is approved for use in development, testing, and production. Organization-level standardization helps contain technical sprawl, particularly in large-scale distributed systems.

== Requirements levels

Throughout the technical standards documents, the capitalized keywords "REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "OPTIONAL", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC2119].

== Style guide

=== Language

All content is written in American English.

=== Conventions

URLs containing variables are written according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570[IETF RFC 6570: URI Template]. For example, a URL containing a variable called `account_id` would be shown as `api.example.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}`.

=== Terminology

// TODO

== Contributing

These technical standards are living documents. To make changes to a technical standard, or to create a new one, use the normal pull request workflow via GitHub.

Technical standards documents are written in the AsciiDoc format, as specified in the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoctor docs]. Long technical standards documents – with two or more sections – MUST include a table of contents, generated automatically by the AsciiDoc processor. Use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/toc/position/[TOC macro] to control the position of the TOC in each document, after the introductory text and before the first section.

```

Any books, blogs, or other third-party media that influenced the content of a technical standard MUST be listed in a "`References`" section at the end of the document.
