= Technical Standards

These technical standards are a set of general guidelines for software
development that I have curated to help me write high quality, high value
software products.

The scope of these technical standards is broad. At the highest levels they
cover principles of software design and architecture, and at lower levels they
cover coding conventions for a wide variety of computer languages.

== Requirements levels

Throughout the technical standards documents, the capitalized keywords
"REQUIRED", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"OPTIONAL", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt[RFC 2119].

== Formatting

Technical standards documents are written in the AsciiDoc format, as
specified in the AsciiDoctor docs:

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/

=== Tables of contents

Long technical standards documents MUST include a table of contents. This
can be generated automatically by the AsciiDoc processor. It is RECOMMENDED
to use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/toc/position/[TOC macro]
to control the position of the TOC in each document. Example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= TS-1: Example Technical Standard
:toc: macro

Some introductory text here.

toc::[]

== Section 1
