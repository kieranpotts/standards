= Threat modeling

== What is threat modeling?

Threat modeling is the process of analyzing representations of a system with the purpose of identifying potential security and privacy vulnerabilities, and deciding on mitigation strategies.

Threat modeling is more of a process than a tool or an artifact.

Threat modeling works best when it is iterative, baked into the regular development process, rather than a one-time activity. Threat modeling sessions SHOULD begin during the design phase of a new software product. Thereafter, the threat assessments SHOULD be treated as living documents that are regularly revised as the system evolves, new threats emerge, or business requirements change.

Threat modeling sessions SHOULD NOT be postponed until the product/system is nearly ready to ship to production. Iterative threat assessment is RECOMMENDED because you will catch potential vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, when they will be cheaper to remediate. Because security and privacy requirements are cross-cutting architectural concerns, they tend to be expensive to retrofit into an established architecture.

Effective threat modeling benefits from a multi-disciplinary approach, too. Participants in threat modeling sessions should be drawn from architecture and security, product and business, and development, testing, and operations. The purpose is to view the system from diverse perspectives.

It is RECOMMENDED to schedule threat modeling sessions at the break point between each iterative development/release cycle.

Various types of models SHOULD be used as input to threat modeling sessions. Different representations of a system will reveal different categories of potential attack vectors. RECOMMENDED models include:

* Infrastructure.
* Data (in situ and in transit).
* Services and components.
* Component boundaries and interfaces.
* Business processes (or application logic).
* External dependencies.

The output of threat modeling sessions is a set of identified threats, with associated risk ratings and mitigation strategies.

See also the https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/[Threat Modeling Manifesto] for more information about the principles of threat modeling.

== Threat modeling methodologies

Potential threats SHOULD be identified using a structured methodology. The following standardized threat modeling frameworks are helpful. You may choose to use a combination of these frameworks, or a custom methodology tailored to your own needs.

=== STRIDE

Developed by Microsoft, this mnemonic-based framework categorizes threats into six groups:

|===
|Threat category |Definition |Example |Example of countermeasures

|*Spoofing*
|Impersonation of another user or system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack[Wikipedia])
|Faking an email address to manipulate the recipient into sharing confidential information
|Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and/or DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to verify the sender

|*Tampering*
|Unauthorized modification of data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampering_%28crime%29[Wikipedia])
|Modifying data on a website to redirect visitors to a phishing page
|Hashes and digital signatures for data validation and tamper detection

|*Repudiation*
|Measures that attackers take to leave no trace of their malicious actions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation[Wikipedia])
|Altering log files to hide unauthorized access
|Audit and logging mechanisms to track all system activity, and automated log analysis to reveal suspicious events

|*Information disclosure*
|Leaking sensitive data to unauthorized parties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach[Wikipedia])
|Hacking into a database to steal credit card information
|Encryption of sensitive data, and access control mechanisms

|*Denial of service (DoS)*
|Rendering a system unusable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack[Wikipedia])
|Flooding a website with excessive requests to crash the server
|Rate limiting to prevent DoS, and load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers

|*Elevation of privilege*
|Gaining higher access levels than authorized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation[Wikipedia])
|Exploiting a vulnerability to elevate user permissions, allowing access to confidential data or systems
|Implementing the principle of least privilege with role-based access controls
|===

=== PASTA

PASTA – Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis – is a multi-stage methodology that aligns business objectives with technical requirements. The stages progress through:

1. Defining the business objectives.
2. Defining the technical scope.
3. Decomposing the application into its component parts.
4. Identifying potential vulnerabilities.
5. Enumerating the likelihood and impact of attacks.

To identify potential vulnerabilities, analysts use either the STRIDE framework or a vulnerability database, such as the https://www.cve.org/[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)] database, the https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html[Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)] list, the https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search#/nvd/home?resultType=records[National Vulnerability Database (NVD)], or the https://owasp.org/Top10/[OWASP Top 10] list from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project.

The end result is a comprehensive risk and impact assessment. PASTA can be a very time-consuming process so it does not lend itself to fast iterative development processes. It is most suited to long-lived critical systems.

=== VAST

VAST – Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling – is designed to scale threat modeling across entire organizations and to work well with iterative development workflows. VAST's scalability makes it a good fit for organizations with multiple teams and products, and short release cycles.

VAST covers two types of threat modeling:

* Application threat modeling for development teams, focusing on process flow diagrams.
* Operational threat modeling for infrastructure teams, focusing on attack trees.

=== LINDDUN

LINDDUN is a privacy-focused threat modeling frameworks and it serves as a privacy-oriented counterpart to STRIDE. LINDDUN helps identify privacy threats by systematically examining how personal data flows through a system and where privacy violations may occur.

The name is an acronym for: Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unwareness, Non-compliance.

LINDDUN is recommended for systems handling personal information, particularly those subject to regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

=== Attack trees

Attack trees are hierarchical diagrams representing how attackers might compromise a system to achieve a specific goal.

The tree's root represents the attacker's ultimate objective, with branches showing different paths or sub-goals needed to achieve it. Leaf nodes represent specific actions or vulnerabilities the attacker could exploit. Attack trees can be enriched with attributes like cost, likelihood, or required skill level.

Attack trees are useful models for visualizing complex attack scenarios that require multiple steps to compromise a system.

=== Kill chains

A kill chain (or cyber kill chain) is a framework originally developed by Lockheed Martin that models the stages of a cyber attack. The traditional seven stages are:

1. *Reconnaissance*: research and target identification.
2. *Weaponization*: creating a malicious payload.
3. *Delivery*: transmitting the weapon to the target.
4. *Exploit*: triggering the exploit.
5. *Installation*: installing malware.
6. *Command and control*: establishing remote access.
7. *Actions on objectives*: achieving the attacker's goal.

Understanding these stages helps defenders implement layered defenses. The framework is particularly valuable for understanding advanced threats.

== Risk ratings

Each identified threat SHOULD be rated based on its likelihood of occurrence and scale of impact. Combining the likelihood and impact scores gives an overall severity level, typically rated from high to low.

The following diagram shows a common risk rating scheme. You may design your own scoring system. The important thing is to be consistent in how you rank potential threats.

image::./_/threat-rating-scheme.png[alt="",width=685,height=581]

== Mitigation strategies

The final stage of the threat modeling process is to decide on mitigation strategies for each identified threat. The rationale for the chosen countermeasures – or the reasons why no mitigation will be done – SHOULD be recorded against each threat.

Examples of countermeasures against common threats include:

* Two-factor authentication.
* Role-based access controls.
* Encryption of sensitive data at rest.
* Encrypted transport protocols.
* Message signatures.
* Logging, monitoring, and alerts.
* Rate limiting.
* Reducing data retention periods.
* Code review.
* Log rotation.
* Penetration testing.
* Dependency updates.
* Dependency version pinning.
* Scheduled security scans.

== Threat modeling sessions

Threat modeling sessions should be driven by a facilitator, with the rest of the participants serving as security analysts.

The meeting SHOULD follow a structured approach. The following steps are RECOMMENDED:

1. Review business objectives and scope.
2. Review component architecture, data flows, system interfaces, etc.
3. Systematically assess threats (eg. STRIDE) against individual components.
4. Rank risks based on assessment of likelihood and impact.
5. Identify and prioritize mitigation strategies.

The outcome of the threat modeling session is a list of identified threats, risk ratings, and agreed mitigation strategies (if any), captured in a threat assessment table. See below for a template.

=== Prompts

In threat modeling sessions, analysts systematically examine each system component against these six threat categories to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system design. The following questions serve as useful prompts in threat modeling sessions to identify potential vulnerabilities in each STRIDE category:

.Legend
****
* [G] = General
* [DD] = Data store (eg. databases, file storage)
* [EE] = External entities (eg. users, third-party services)
* [DF] = Data flow (eg. API calls, HTTP requests, DB queries)
****

* *Spoofing*:

** How is identity verified before processing data? [G]
** Can an attacker pretend to be another user or system? [G]
** Who is allowed to connect, and how are they authenticated? [DS]
** How do we verify the external entity is who they claim to be? [EE]
** Is the data flow authenticated and authorized? [DF]

* *Tampering*:

** How are inputs validated and sanitized? [G]
** Can an attacker modify parameters, headers, or messages? [G]
** Can unauthorized users modify stored data? [DS]
** Are there integrity checks? [DS]
** Could a user or external service send forged or malicious data? [EE]
** Is the data in transit protected (eg. HTTPS, signatures)? [DF]

* *Repudiation*:

** Are actions logged with enough context to hold users accountable? [G]
** Are logs tamper-proof and audit-ready? [G]
** Can changes be traced to specific users or actions? [DS]
** Can external interactions be logged and attributed? [EE]
** Are interactions recorded for forensic and audit purposes? [DF]

* *Information disclosure*:

** Could sensitive data (eg. stack traces, debug info) be unintentionally exposed? [G]
** Is sensitive data encrypted at rest? [DS]
** Are access controls in place? [DS]
** Do we expose more data than necessary to the external party? [EE]
** Can sensitive data be intercepted or leaked during transmission? [DF]

* *Denial of service (DoS)*:

** Can the process be overwhelmed (eg. resource exhaustion, connection flooding)? [G]
** Are rate limits and throttling mechanisms in place? [G]
** Can storage be filled or locked, causing failure? [DS]
** Can external users/services flood or overload the system? [EE]
** Can the flow be abused to create excessive load? [DF]

* *Elevation of privilege*:

** Could a user escalate privileges through flaws in logic or configuration? [G]
** Are there role-based access controls in place? [G]
** Can someone gain unauthorized access via misconfigured permissions? [DS]
** Can an external entity access functions they shouldn't? [EE]
** Are there logic flaws in how flows are authorized or processed? [DF]

* *Additional questions*:

** What happens when the application is under attack?
** What's the security posture of third-party components?
** Are default credentials or insecure configurations present?
** What monitoring and altering systems are in place for suspicious activity?

## 1. Business context

What are the business objectives? Why does the system exist? What business value does it provide? What are the critical business functions?

Who are the key stakeholders?

What is the business impact of security/privacy failures – eg. financial, reputational, regulatory, operational, etc.?

## 2. Technical scope

Define what is being threat modeled. What the system boundaries, or the in-scope components?

What is the technology stack? What are the deployment environments? What are the integration points or interfaces with other (out-of-scope) systems?

## 3. Decomposition

How does the system work?

Include or link to architectural diagrams and other useful design documents and models.

Use the models to identify key components, data flows, entry points, trust boundaries, and the most sensitive assets.

### Key components

Identify the key components of the system, along with their trust levels and the categories of data they handle. Internal components tend to be trusted while external ones are not; components at the interface between internal and external components, such as API gateways, are semi-trusted.

|Component |Description |Trust level |Data handled |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|
|...       |...         |...         |...          |
|...       |...         |...         |...          |
|...       |...         |...         |...          |

### Data flows

Identify the data flows between the key components. Include details of data types, transport protocols (and whether they are encrypted), and any authentication or signing systems in place.

|Source |Destination |Data type |Protocol |Authentication |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|----------------|
|...    |...         |...      |...      |...             |
|...    |...         |...      |...      |...             |
|...    |...         |...      |...      |...             |

### Sensitive assets

Identify the assets that must be protected from unauthorized access, eg. data, keys, certificates, and other secrets.

|Asset |Sensitivity |Integrity requirements |Availability requirements |Privacy concern |
|------|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
|...   |...         |...                    |...                       |...             |
|...   |...         |...                    |...                       |...             |
|...   |...         |...                    |...                       |...             |

### Entry points

Identify the external interfaces, APIs, and user interfaces to the system.

### Trust boundaries

Identify where trust changes, eg. internet to DMZ, DMZ to internal network.

## Threat assessment

Finally, consider the potential threats against the identified components, data flows, and assets. Use the STRIDE framework to rank each threat against each component/flow and rank the resulting risks.

|Ref |Component/Flow |Description |Type |Countermeasures |Likelihood |Impact |Rating |
|----|---------------|------------|-----|----------------|-----------|-------|-------|
|TA1 |...            |..          |...  |...             |...        |...    |...    |
|TA2 |...            |..          |...  |...             |...        |...    |...    |
|TA3 |...            |..          |...  |...             |...        |...    |...    |
|TA4 |...            |..          |...  |...             |...        |...    |...    |
|TA5 |...            |..          |...  |...             |...        |...    |...    |

(Add links to issue trackers, resolution deadlines, etc. as required.)
----

For the threat assessment, an alternative structure is to analyze each component's vulnerability a list of threat types – eg. the STRIDE categories, or the OWASP Top 10 – to determine if a sensitive asset can be compromised by each particular attack vector.
