== Consuming open source actions

There are many open source GitHub Actions that can be plugged in to your own
GitHub automation workflows. However, just like with any open source software,
open source actions MUST be carefully audited before integrating them into your
development toolchain. The following steps are RECOMMENDED:

* Use only actions that are published to the GitHub Marketplace, and only actions
  that have been verified by GitHub.
* Review the action's `action.yml` file for inputs and outputs, and check that
  the code does what it says it does.
* Include a specific version of the action, which you have audited. Best practice
  is to specify a commit SHA, rather than a branch or version tag. This ensures
  that the action's code is locked down and cannot be changed without your
  explicitly updating the version reference in your workflow configuration.
