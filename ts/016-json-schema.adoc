= TS-16: JSON Schema
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard sets out some guidelines for JSON schema. The emphasis on this technical standard is on _designing_ JSON schema, though there is also some information on using published JSON schemas such as JSON-LD.

JSON Schema provides a vocabulary for describing the structure of JSON data. Documentation, code, and other artifacts can be generated from JSON Schema definitions, but the primary use case if to validate JSON documents.

JSON schema is commonly used to define the structure of data transferred between systems via network APIs. It may also be used for input validation, to define interfaces for data structures constructed at runtime, and to define data persistence schema (eg. document stores).
