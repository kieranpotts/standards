= TS-16: JSON Schema
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard sets out some guidelines for designing JSON schema.

JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents. It is used to define the structure of JSON data for the purpose of validation and documentation.

JSON schema is commonly used to define the structure of data transferred between systems via network APIs. It may also be used for input validation, to define interfaces for data structures constructed at runtime, and to define data persistence schema (eg. document stores).
