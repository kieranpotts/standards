= Versioning standards

All releases MUST use a versioning scheme that is compatible with
https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0].

SemVer is more useful in libraries and web services, rather than GUIs and
applications. But we SHOULD use it consistently for all types of computer
program.

Public releases MAY aso be given names, eg "Autumn 2025".

== Semantic versioning

* MAJOR version: includes incompatible or breaking API changes. For GUIs,
  a breaking change could be considered to be a change in the behavior of
  an existing UI control, or removal of existing controls.

* MINOR version: includes functional changes added in a backwards-compatible
  manner.

* PATCH version: includes backwards-compatible bug fixes and minor enhancements.

== Pre-production releases
