= TS-9: Performance (Non-Functional) Testing
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard focuses on testing strategies that help us to evaluate the performance of a software system. The term "performance" is used to encapsulate all the dynamic quality attributes of a software system: its speed, capacity, security, availability, scalability, and so on. These are also known as non-functional requirements (NFRs) or cross-functional requirements (CFRs).
