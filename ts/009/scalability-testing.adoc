= Scalability testing

Web services SHOULD be developed for *horizontal scalability*, ie. the ability to add more instances of the application to handle increased load.

Scalability testing is the practice of verifying how quickly new instances can be provisioned when demand increases. If this process is automated (known as *auto-scaling*), the outcome of this testing is a number that represents the time lag between a spike in demand and the availability of new instances.
