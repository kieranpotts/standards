= Capacity testing

Capacity testing, also known as load testing, is one of the hardest things to do in performance testing. But it's important for web services. You don't want to be surprised by these things - to discover the limits in production.

Capacity is a requirement like any other, and it must be specified and tested.

Capacity is not only about the number of possible concurrent requests or users. It's also about things like batch record processing, and support file sizes for upload and download.

Related tests include:

* Response times
* Transaction rates
* Number of concurrent users
