= Shift left

Too often, performance testing is treating as a last-mile quality gate before release. This approach carries enormous risks. Better to validate performance requirements continuously, with every incremental change.

Shifting left performance testing, by integrating performance evaluation early in the software development lifecycle, reduces the risks associated with the delivery of software changes.

When performance problems are discovered late in development – in the worst cases, only after the changes are deployed to production – the remediation effort can be orders-of-magnitude greater than if they were discovered earlier. That's because performance requirements are usually architecturally-significant, cross-cutting concerns, requiring design choices to be made at every level of the software stack, from the infrastructure and data storage, to the application logic and user interfaces.

By testing performance during the design and development phases, teams can identify bottlenecks, scalability limitations, and resource constraints when they're far easier and cheaper to address.

Early detection of performance issues prevents the cascading effects of poor performance choices that become deeply embedded in the application architecture.

Moreover, shifting left performance testing fundamentally changes team culture and accountability. When developers receive immediate feedback on the performance impact of their code – eg. through automated performance tests in CI/CD pipelines or local development environments – they become more performance-conscious in their daily work.
