= TS-X Guidelines for Version Control with Git

All code and configuration MUST be stored in a version control system.

For each repository, there MUST be a single centralized repository that is the
"source of truth" for the codebase.

== Coding standards

Code within the same repository SHOULD follow a consistent coding standard.
The only exception permitted is mono-repos, where different parts of a system
may be written in different languages and for different platforms.
