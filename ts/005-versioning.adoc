Software components that are dependencies of other systems – such as libraries and web services – SHOULD use a consistent versioning scheme for their releases. This makes it easier to manage compatibility between components.

== Semantic versioning

It is RECOMMENDED to uss the https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] scheme for versioning software components. This is a widely adopted standard.

Semantic version numbers follow this format:
----
v{major}.{minor}.{patch}
----

* *{major}*: Increment this number by 1 when the release includes incompatible or breaking API changes. For user-facing GUIs, a breaking change could be considered to be a change in the behavior of an existing UI control, or removal of existing controls.

* *{minor}*: Increment this number by 1 when the release includes functional changes added in a backwards-compatible manner.

* *{patch}*: Increment this number by 1 when the release includes backwards-compatible bug fixes, refactors, maintenance chores, and other minor enhancements.

The following is a representative chronology of semantic version number progressions:

* `v1.0.0`
* `v1.1.0`
* `v1.2.0`
* `v1.2.1`
* `v2.0.0`
* `v2.0.1`
* `v2.0.2`
* `v2.1.0`

== Version zero

`v0.x.x` releases MAY NOT comply with the Semantic Versioning rules.

Version zero releases SHOULD be used to preview, pre-release, or prototype builds of new software. These releases are considered to be unstable and not production-grade. Breaking changes MAY be introduced to version zero releases without bumping then major version number.

== Pre-release versions

For pre-release versions, the semantic version number SHOULD be followed by a hyphen and then the word "alpha", "beta", "rc" (release candidate), followed by a dot and then a zero-indexed incrementing integer.

v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{inc}

Example of a release order, top-to-bottom

----
v1.0.0-alpha.0
v1.0.0-alpha.1
v1.0.0-alpha.2
v1.0.0-beta.0
v1.0.0-beta.1
v1.0.0
v1.1.0-alpha.0
v1.1.0-alpha.1
v1.1.0-beta.0
v1.1.0
----

This is an extension of the Semantic Versioning standard and is based on the convention used by the NPM registry of JavaScript packages. This convention may need to be adapted for other package managers and software ecosystems.

== LTS releases

For long-term support releases, " LTS" MAY be appended to the version number.

* `v1.0.0`
* `v1.1.0`
* `v1.2.0`
* `v1.3.0 LTS`
* `v1.4.0`
* `v1.5.0`
* `v2.0.0`
* `v2.1.0 LTS`
* `v2.2.0`

== Named releases

In addition to a version number, consumer-friendly release names such as "Autumn 2025" MAY be used for user-facing software applications.
