This technical standard covers testing strategies to evaluate the correct operation of a software system.

A system is said to be "correct" when it performs its intended functions correctly, across various scenarios including normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions.

Functional testing is the cornerstone of software quality assurance. It involves recording the behaviors observed in user workflows and business logic against expected outcomes as specified in the system requirements.
