= TS-X Data Protection Standards

== Privacy by Design

Privacy by Design (PbD) is an approach to protecting personal data that embeds
privacy controls in the design of a system, and in business processes.
Organizations that adapt PhD practices reduce the risk of privacy violations.

Teams SHOULD think creatively and identify opportunities to more closely
align PbD principles through alternative approaches, for example how data will
be stored and displayed.

== Logs

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) MUST NOT be sent to log output.

== Data retention

Database tables MUST have a mechanism in place to remove older data over time,
in accordance with data retention policies.

Data SHOULD NOT be retained for longer than it is required to fulfil specific
business or user functions. In general, data stores SHOULD NOT grow in size
indefinitely.
