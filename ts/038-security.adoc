This technical standard covers security requirements for applications and best practices for secrets management.

== Encryption

Personal data, or any business-sensitive information, MUST be encrypted at rest.

All data MUST be encrypted in transit (ie. TLS).

== Vulnerabilities

Source code MUST be scanned for vulnerabilities prior to release. It is recommended to use a combination of Static Application Security Testing (SAST), eg. Checkmarx, and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), eg. OWASP ZAP.

High-level issues identified by SAST/DAST tools SHOULD be prioritized similarly to incidents.

Low-level issues identified by SAST/DAST tools SHOULD be prioritized with high priority.

Third-party software components MUST be checked for security vulnerabilities and license changes, using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool such as Mend.

== Secrets

A *secret* is any value that grants access or trust when revealed. If you can unlock a system, sign code, or impersonate a user â€“ it's a secret.

Secrets include, but are not limited to:

* Passwords and passphrases
* API access keys and fine-grained personal access tokens (PATs)
* SSH keys and other encryption keys, and TLS private certs
* JWTs, session cookies, and signed URLs
* Configuration strings that embed credentials, eg. for database connections

*Secrets MUST NOT ever be hard-coded in source code.*

Instead, secrets must be stored in a secure vault or secrets management system, and securely fetched then injected into the application at compile time or runtime.

Secrets management systems are designed to store, manage, and provide access to secrets in a secure manner.

Use secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store primary secrets that are required by applications at runtime. Examples include database connection credentials and encryption keys. The credentials should be configured to be automatically rotated on a regular basis, ideally at least once every 24 hours.

Workflow secrets are another category of secrets that are used primarily in CI/CD pipelines. This category of secrets also include short-lived API keys and OIDC audience strings. These secrets are typically stored in the secrets management tools embedded in the CI/CD tools themselves, such as GitHub Secrets. The lifetime of these secrets should be less than 90 days, rotated in line with PAT cadence.

Secrets MUST NOT be sent to log output.
