== Encryption

Personal data, or any business-sensitive information, MUST be encrypted at rest.

All data MUST be encrypted in transit (ie. TLS).

== Vulnerabilities

Source code MUST be scanned for vulnerabilities prior to release. It is recommended to use a combination of Static Application Security Testing (SAST), eg. Checkmarx, and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), eg. OWASP ZAP.

High-level issues identified by SAST/DAST tools SHOULD be prioritized similarly to incidents.

Low-level issues identified by SAST/DAST tools SHOULD be prioritized with high priority.

Third-party software components MUST be checked for security vulnerabilities and license changes, using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool such as Mend.
