= TS-11: Application Architecture
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard sets out principles and best practices for designing and implementing standalone software applications.

An application is defined here as a software component that runs in a single process and is designed to perform a specific function or set of functions. An application may be a standalone executable, a library, or a service or microservice within a larger distributed system.

In client-server systems such as web applications, the client-side application may specialize in only the user interface, while the server-side application specializes in data processing, business logic, and state persistence. GUI applications tend to require a specialist architecture, which is outside of the scope of this technical standard.
