= Exit codes

In Unix-like environments, exit codes are how scripts determine whether a command succeeded or failed. You MUST report these correctly.

Return a *zero exit code* on success and any *non-zero exit code* on failure.

Error codes SHOULD be positive integers of 1 or greater. Reserve 1 for a general, undocumented error. Map other errors codes (of 2 or higher) to the various failure modes of your program, and document these.

Thus, there SHOULD be a unique exit code for each type of failed operation in your program. Each of these failure modes MUST be fastidiously documented. One of the reasons to consult documentation is to fix errors. That is why all types of error from a program MUST be documented.

Error messages SHOULD be written to stderr when a command returns a non-zer exit code. See the section on link:./errors.adoc[errors] for more guidance on how error messages can be used to support debugging of failure modes.
