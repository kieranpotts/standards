= Distribution

Where possible, CLI programs SHOULD be distributed as either binaries or via the platform's native package management system.

CLI programs MUST be easy to uninstall. Distributing binaries or native packages means you're not scattering things on disk that can't be easily removed. Tread lightly on your users' computers.
