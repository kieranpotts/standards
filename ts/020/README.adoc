= TS-20: Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard covers the design of command line interfaces (CLIs). The focus here is on designing CLI utilities for Unix-based environments, but the guidelines are intended to be applicable to the CLIs of programs running in all kinds of environments – Windows, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.

These technical standards build on the https://clig.dev/[Command Line Interface Guidelines], an excellent open source guide to writing better command line programs. Other references are listed at the end of this document.

CLIs are a type of UI, and therefore this technical standard can be seen as an extension of link:../014/README.adoc[TS-14: *User Interfaces*]. Terminal user interfaces (TUIs), which are full-screen terminal programs like Vim and Emacs, are not addressed by this standard. This standard is all about designing interactive command-oriented CLI utilities.
