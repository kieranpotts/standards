= TS-X Release Testing Standards

== Alpha (Testing)

== Beta (Testing)

Beta versions of software updates SHOULD be released to a limited number of end
users.

Beta testing is performed by real users in real (production) environments. It
can be considered a form of external User Acceptance Testing, and the main
purpose of this testing strategy is to get direct feedback from real users
in the software's real production environment.

NOTE: Beta testing is not the same as canary testing, which is more automated
and is really about finding _failures_ before they happen globally.

== Release Candidate (RC) Testing
