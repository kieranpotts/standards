== Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a set of criteria that must be met before a user story is considered ready to be worked on. The DoR is a checklist that helps ensure that the team has all the information they need to successfully complete the story.

////

Have enough knowledge of the requirements to make a start on construction, but not necessarily complete the work without feedback.

_What_ is required varies from task to task. So we do _not_ have a definitive checklist, but some guidelines.

* Are the requirements clear and (sufficiently) unambiguous?
* Resources/knowledge required are available.
* Independent: can be work on independently of other tasks; no merge conflicts.
* Negotiable. Technical implementation SHOULD NOT be too rigid.
* Valuable: to at least one group of stakeholders (NOT necessarily the end users).
* Small: a small, integrate-able increment.
* Testable.
