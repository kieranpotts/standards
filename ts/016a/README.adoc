= TS-16a: Webhooks
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard extends *link:../016/README.adoc[TS-16: HTTP APIs]* with specific guidance on the design of webhooks.

This standard leans heavily on https://www.standardwebhooks.com/[Standard Webhooks], which is a community-driven initiative to document best practices for webhook implementation. Other influential sources are listed in the references section at the end of this document.

Protocols such as WebSockets and Server Sent Events, and other such mechanisms that can be used to push data to clients in real-time, are outside of the scope of this technical standard.

* https://www.standardwebhooks.com/[Standard Webhooks] — A well-designed standard for webhook implementation, drawing on industry best practices.

* https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] and the https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/http-webhook.md[CloudEvents Web Hooks for Event Delivery] specification — CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in a common way. It focuses on the event format (the payload) rather than other concerns such as the transport and authentication mechanisms.

* https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/[Shared Signals Framework (SSF)] — This OpenID Foundation initiative is effectively a standard for generalized webhooks. The framework defines stream-based communication mechanisms between "transmitters" (that generate events) and "receivers" (that consume them). It specifies event types, verification mechanisms, and transport protocols. It is part of a suite of standards under the OpenID umbrella, this standard focusing on the secure communication of security-related events. There are some useful security guidelines herein.
