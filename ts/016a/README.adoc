= TS-16a: Webhooks
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard extends *link:../016/README.adoc[TS-16: HTTP APIs]* with specific guidance on the design of webhooks.

There are alternative mechanisms for pushing data to clients in real-time, like WebSockets and Server Sent Events, but these are outside the scope of this standard.

* https://www.standardwebhooks.com/[Standard Webhooks] — A well-designed standard for webhook implementations, drawing on industry best practices. This technical standard is based on Standard Webhooks and is fully compliant with it.

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9421/[RFC 9421: HTTP Message Signatures] — If you prefer a standard solution to create, encode, and verify HTTP message signatures, look to this IETF RFC. https://httpsig.org/[httpsig.org] is an online sandbox to try out HTTP Message Signatures interactively, plus links to implementations in multiple programming languages. This design is much more flexible than Standard Webhooks – for example, producers can specify which parts of their message are signed – but this flexibility will not be required for the majority of webhook use cases, and it comes at much-increased costs for consumers to integrate with. Nevertheless, RFC 9421 may be a better option for some niche use cases.

* https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] and the https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/http-webhook.md[CloudEvents Web Hooks for Event Delivery] specification — CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in a common way. It focuses on the event format (the payload) rather than other concerns such as the transport and authentication mechanisms.

* https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/[Shared Signals Framework (SSF)] — This OpenID Foundation initiative is effectively a standard for generalized webhooks, although the purpose of the standard is more targeted. SSF is intended to improve the interoperability and privacy of identity and access control systems. It enables the secure, real-time communication of security-related events, things like account compromise and session revocation. It is part of a wider set of standards under the OpenID umbrella. There are some useful security guidelines herein, but the standard is not widely adopted outside of the domain of identity and access management.
