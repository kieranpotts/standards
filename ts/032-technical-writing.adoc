== Placeholders

Prefer to use angle brackets (`<>`) to encapsulate any placeholder text that is intended to be swapped for a value, such as a file name or a command line argument.

Use square brackets (`[]`) to indicate optional arguments.

For example:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./run <script> [<script-args>]
----
