= TS-13: Code Design
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

This technical standard covers low-level concerns related to the structure and formatting of code. It covers topics such as naming conventions, commenting best practices, and object-oriented design principles.

These guidelines are language-agnostic. This technical standard is meant to be relevant for any general-purpose, high-level programming language (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.). Some of the content will also be relevant for lower-level languages, such as shell scripting languages like Bash.

For higher-level design concerns, such as architecture and design patterns, see link:./012-application-architecture.adoc[TS-12: Application Architecture] and link:./010-system-design.adoc[TS-10: System Design].
