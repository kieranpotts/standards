== Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a checklist that helps ensure that the team has
completed all the work required to deliver a user story. The DoD is a set of
criteria that must be met before a user story is considered done.

////

The DoD is more important that the DoR, and it is more static – ie. it is less
liable to change from task to task.

== Static analysis

Static code analysis MUST be used to monitor conformance to coding standards and
best practices. These tools MUST also be used to verify code "correctness" –
eg. unreachable code, undefined variables, unused variables, correct number of
arguments, etc. – as much as static analysis allows.

All code changes, inclusive of functional tests, MUST be peer reviewed by at
least two other development or operations team members.

== Runtime analysis

See TS-X Testing Standards.
