= TS-X Application Standards

This document describes the baseline standards for application software
development and maintenance.

Projects that are in a proof-of-concept or discovery-like phase of development
MAY omit some of these standards in order to rapidly learn and gain feedback
and insight.

== Technology stack

Applications MUST use a standardized technology stack. They SHOULD use a common,
stable, well-maintained application framework.
