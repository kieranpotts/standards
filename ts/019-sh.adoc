= TS-19: Unix Shells
:toc: macro
:toc-title: Contents

A Unix shell is an interface that allows users to interact with the operating system, as well as other system and utility software. A Unix shell is both a command language (in which commands are typed and executed interactively via the command line) and a scripting language (in which a sequence of commands are written in a file and executed all at once like a program). The shell interprets user commands and translates them into actions performed by the operating system.

This technical standard covers best practices for written Unix shell scripts, which are commonly used for system administration, automating tasks, and doing batch processing.

== Choice of shells

Well-known Unix shells include the Bourne Shell (`sh`, one of the earliest shells), the Bourne Again Shell (`bash`, which provided a superset of Bourne Shell functionality), C Shell (`csh`) and the improved version tee-shell (`tcsh`), KornShell (`ksh`, which was backwards compatible with Bourne Shell and included many of the features of C Shell), and Z Shell (`zsh`, another popular shell based on Bourne).

== Portability

The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards maintained by the IEEE Computer Society that specify APIs for Unix shells and utility programs, promoting compatibility between various Unix shells and (by extension) the operating systems that use them.

A POSIX-compliant script can be executed with success on any Unix or Unix-like operating system that implements the POSIX standards â€“ which includes Linux, OpenBSD, and others. Such scripts are considered to be "portable".

Most Unix shells are POSIX-compliant, but they add their own proprietary features that are not part of the POSIX standard. These features may not be available in other shells, which can lead to portability issues.

Therefore, when writing shell scripts, it is important to consider the target environment and the shell that will be used to execute the script. If portability between lots of different Unix shell environments is a requirement, it is best to stick to POSIX-compliant features and avoid shell-specific extensions.

Many Unix shells have a "POSIX mode" that allow you to test a scripts POSIX compliance by disabling any non-POSIX features of the shell. For example, in Bash POSIX mode can be enabled by using `sh` or `bash --posix` for execution, or adding the following hashbang to the top of the script:

----
#! /bin/env sh
----

(`#!/bin/sh` can also be used, but it is less portable.)
